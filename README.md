# Data Structures and Algorithms


## Warm Up
  - Some basic python algorithms meant to warm up the brain and gain some confidence before tackling the interview prep.

  - If you are struggling with some of the basic warmup problems I recommend to continue practicing with them until they are understood fully and able to be implemented quickly and efficiently


## Interview Prep
  - Categorized based on the difficulty and algorithm pattern, this is a list of algorithms for me to interview prep.

  - I recommend approaching these problems in order of the categories and difficulty, The files are numbered to make this easier.


## Why Python?
    After learning Ruby and JavaScript I wanted to learn a language that I could things other than Web Development with. I chose Python because I am still interviewing on a consistent basis so its nice to have a default DS&A language that is widely accepted and more importantly "good" for DS&A. I believe Python is just that.
